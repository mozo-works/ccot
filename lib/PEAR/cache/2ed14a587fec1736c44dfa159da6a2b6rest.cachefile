For having a quick but working prototype of your application, simply model the database, run DataObject's createTable script over it and write a script that passes one of the resulting objects to the FormBuilder class. The FormBuilder will automatically generate a simple but working HTML_QuickForm object that you can use to test your application. It also provides a processing method that will automatically detect if an insert() or update() command has to be executed after the form has been submitted. If you have set up DataObject's links.ini file correctly, it will also automatically detect if a table field is a foreign key and will populate a selectbox with the linked table's entries. There are many optional parameters that you can place in your DataObjects.ini or in the properties of your derived classes, that you can use to fine-tune the form-generation, gradually turning the prototypes into fully-featured forms, and you can take control at any stage of the process.";s:2:"da";s:19:"2005-04-28 13:19:19";s:1:"n";s:730:"Changes
-BC break: Made enum options more flexible
--Options in enumOptions or returned from enumOptionsCallback may be in one of two formats
--If the first key of the array is an integer (such as 0) then the array is reformulated to have each value as the key. In other words, the key information is lost
--If you wish to have the keys kept as-is (inserted into the database as they are) make your keys are strings (such as '0')

-Changed _getPrimaryKey, _date2Array, and _array2Date to allow them to be called statically
Fixes
-Fixed notice when checking crossLink['type']
New Features
-Added return of errors from processForm when DB operations fail
--This is a slight BC break as further operations will no longer be attempted";s:1:"f";s:5:"41981";s:1:"g";s:56:"http://pear.php.net/get/DB_DataObject_FormBuilder-0.14.0";s:1:"x";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:18:"package.0.14.0.xml";}}}
