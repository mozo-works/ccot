Running into the White Cow

I was riding my bike and turning the corner on a busy street when I ran into a big white cow. For a moment I lost my balance and awkwardly fell. As the cow passed beside me, it rolled its big eyeballs and patiently gazed down upon me. The cow looked so large and majestic that I almost dropped to my knees to bow my head before it. The cow slowly turned its head and looked at the street with the severity of one uttering some grave prophecy. The street was bustling with peddlers and their goods and the vagrants who had gathered there. Their shouts and curses and laughter and cunning pooled in the street. I saw an unbelievably large hump moving on the cow’s back. The cow lifted its horns, which were as big as its body, as if ready to say something. The bones protruding from its whole body wriggled terribly, seeming to show the cow had reached an extreme point of desperation.

But at that instant, a sharp whip cracked against the cow’s back, and it reared its head back with a bellow. After a while, the cow managed to draw in its long extended tongue and began to plod once more. The cow was pulling a cart laden with countless stacks of grain, farming implements, furniture, and a poor family. A newborn baby was crying, exhausted from the heat, and a blind old man stared at me for a long, long time until the cart vanished around a bend in the road.
