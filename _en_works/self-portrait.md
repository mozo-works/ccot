> "A dream of a futile desire drawn on the white wall!

A man draws his own confession against himself, the society and the world outside on the white wall. The struggle starts between the painter who draws and the figure in the picture. The painter and the figure are the self-portrait of each other and furthermore the reflection of us in this modern society.

This work is the performance with the fresh artistic material, such as painting, video, body, live music, poem etc. Lee Cheol-Sung, a director of ‘CCOT’ tries to reconcile and connect all Kinds of arts for our portrait.
