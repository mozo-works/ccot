You and Me


You and me sitting here on this bench and
smelling the scent of winter
you and me losing our words as the deep just keeps getting wider
with this scent that swept past in an instant
me unable to take your hand and
you flowing into the deep part of me
you bleak as the wind and
clear as the air
falling and halting and
halted forever
you as beautiful as a picture
as awful as a memory
wishing that I were your father and
wishing that you were my mother
sitting here on this bench where the cold trees stand
hoping.
Hoping a child doesn’t become another child’s friend
hoping a girl doesn’t become a boy’s lover
and so between the clear sky and the empty street
the stopped bus and passing time
your eyes are as beautiful as a picture
giving off the scent of winter
fading into the winter sky
the well that I fell into
becomes a mirror.
