- update and insert now return FALSE on error conditions (Peter Gebauer)
  which can be checked using === FALSE, and the error obtained using $object->_lastError
- delete will only use primary keys if they are set, otherwise it will use all object 
  variables to build the condition. (Daniel Ferreira)
- Added derivedHookFunctions(), and derivedHookVar() to enable extensions to generator to
  make user defined methods. (Michael Lund Rasmussen)
- support for INT4, BPCHAR, TIMESTAMPTZ  and postres Primary keys (Xavier)
- better PEAR CS complience (tabs and TRUE -> true), removed short open tags in generator (Thomas Volkmar Worm)
- experimental addJoin method (Stijn de Reede)
- Allow active options array (eg. dynamic changing of database config) (Sergey Lipnevich)";s:1:"f";s:5:"16891";s:1:"g";s:41:"http://pear.php.net/get/DB_DataObject-0.8";s:1:"x";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:15:"package.0.8.xml";}}}
