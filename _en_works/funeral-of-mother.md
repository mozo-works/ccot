### Deep sadness and Irony!

### Video reflex theater, Mis en scene of Animation

&nbsp;

Video performance rendering of a story about a lonely man who has spent a very long time in a small, dark room, and has lost his mother a week before. He conducts a serious struggle with his grief and loneliness, and finally accept his mother's death and his miserable present with compassion.

### 'It's You that imprisons youself!'

### A story about mirror with a sad body

&nbsp;

A sad story, but from time to time, even funny, because the object of his struggle and constant search, is... himself!

A huge screen, a projector, a digital video camera and live performer reveal a poetic and sometimes fearful space, dreams, illusions and reflections.
