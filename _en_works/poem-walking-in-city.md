2021 Seoul Street Arts Festival 'Official Program!' 
2022 New creation Supported by Seoul Street Arts Creation Center of Seoul Foundation for Culture and Arts

---

(The local participants, who made a reservaton for this project, walk around each corners of the City and leave their traces and marks behind them doing artistic activities such as writing poems, installation and performance.)

```
“We’re now passing in the middle of dark inner organ of a giant animal named ‘The City’, with a line of poem like a candle light in our hands!”
```

A group of nomads(local participants) in strange costume appear in the middle of City, which is full of apartments and ultra high buildings, etc. etc. They pass all kinds of areas of the city such as new town zone, old town zone, traditional market place, narrow streets, overhead bridge, etc. and go forward to the heart of giant city without stopping. And they leave their traces and marks behind them doing artistic activities such as writing poems, installation and performance.

The locals who participate in this project pass through the inner organ of a giant animal named ‘The City’ as leading performers. This ritual passage reveals our over-desires and wandering in nowaday the city, and reveals uneasy and embarrassing faces of the city by our actions of deviation.

We had given birth to this city and it gave birth to our babies. That’s why we proceed with this project.
