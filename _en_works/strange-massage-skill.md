Aluminium foil, originally used for food wrapping, is used for our body wrapping for body massage in this performance. A foil human with the shape of real body is created surprisingly from this process and gets alive. He starts to stand up, walk, make interactions with us and leads us to strange and mysterious dramatic situations. In the end we get to find the foil body torn and scattered on the spot. We wrap foods with this and share them to eat.

The staggering dance between the fragile, vain body and the spirit with eager and thirsty shouts!
A strange and mysterious massage skill touches you.
