### Reincarnation of Shadows!

### A Sculpture-shadow theater with flashlights and large screen

&nbsp;

Through shadow images created by pieces of materials, flashlights and big screens, From the shadow tells a story how devastated one's heart can be cured by love. You will witness beautiful, sometimes grotesque, reflections of material pieces, and the story develops following the flow from reality, internal mind, and memory and to reality.

### 'A Flower on the dead tree'

### A lost love story of a man who becomes a shadow!

&nbsp;

At an art exhibition, a shadow of sculpture drives a man, who was badly hurt by social violance and lost a meaning in his life, to start a journey into his memories. In his memory, he found a woman who once gave him unconditional love and the memory gives him courage to face all the difficulties he is facing now in reality.
