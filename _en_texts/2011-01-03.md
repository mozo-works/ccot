A Piece of the Dream


Early in the morning I woke from sleep
and went out to the sea.
A dog followed through the thick darkness
limping on one leg,
the
dog crept up to the palm tree where I sat
its whole body oozing puss from some awful disease.
Our eyes met
its red fur, eyes,
flashing deep in its eyes
the darkness of desire!
when the sun flicked its tongue above the sea in the thirsty morning
the
red hair
frantically leapt over my head and
vanished into the bed
a piece of the dream



               -Sinai, Egypt
