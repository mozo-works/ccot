## Self-Massager

- Healing performance for Myself in Pandemic era!

A Heartwarming Hour for Myself, Who is Fragile As Paper!

How does the Art have to answer to the isolation of humans in the pandemic era? ‘Self-Massager’ is the new creation from ‘Massager’, the main work of CCOT, for an answer to this pandemic era.

The massagers who have given the massage activities for their guests give a special paper massage for themselves in each one’s isolated place. This leads to create 'Paper Humans' as copies of their bodies and reveal the fragile existence of Human! A performance of art therapy that makes all the participants feel their fragility and hug each other.
