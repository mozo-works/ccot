Golden Fish

Ear infections take a while.
Today, I wrap myself in two heavy blankets
and groan.
Body ache and a cold
has my wife come down with a sickness of the mind lately
She sits as still as a statue after busily working
when I go to her, there are tears.
Today
Our two weary bodies lie next to each other
we discuss the meaningless of life
and living
and the frailty of it.
Our five-year-old daughter leaps on the bed and the floor,
swinging a toy golf club.
Glorious shrieks
mercilessly stepping on our frightened bodies
she is a golden fish that 
leaps up, trampling on frail creatures.
