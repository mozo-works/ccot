The Street Where the Pipa Boy Disappeared


On the street, a boy is playing a pipa
and his young sister is beating a drum
the boy’s inspired singing and playing
vanquished the street in an instant.
The people lock up their mouths
the street opens its secret ears
an aged woman’s legs dance like an ailing vagrant
the coins in purses danced
and went into the musician’s bag.
The singing had no end
and the playing of the boy with his eyes closed had no end
could the people who had opened the ears of their hearts
not see the unfamiliar look made by the boy
as he hurriedly shut the bag of money and disappeared?
On the street where the music disappeared
the people stand like empty plastic bags blowing in the wind.
