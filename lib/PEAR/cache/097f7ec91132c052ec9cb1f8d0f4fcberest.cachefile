For having a quick but working prototype of your application, simply model the database, run DataObject's createTable script over it and write a script that passes one of the resulting objects to the FormBuilder class. The FormBuilder will automatically generate a simple but working HTML_QuickForm object that you can use to test your application. It also provides a processing method that will automatically detect if an insert() or update() command has to be executed after the form has been submitted. If you have set up DataObject's links.ini file correctly, it will also automatically detect if a table field is a foreign key and will populate a selectbox with the linked table's entries. There are many optional parameters that you can place in your DataObjects.ini or in the properties of your derived classes, that you can use to fine-tune the form-generation, gradually turning the prototypes into fully-featured forms, and you can take control at any stage of the process.";s:2:"da";s:19:"2005-04-08 13:51:59";s:1:"n";s:704:"-Fix Bug #3877 extra fields in crosslink table lost on update to parent table when crossLink type is select
-Fix fatal errors when crossLinkExtraFields is set and the crossLink is of type 'select'
-Removed all direct use of Primary Key from crossLink and tripleLink code as it was technically incorrect. It now uses the value from the links.ini
-Fixed issue with populateOptions being called in DataObject callbacks other than preGenerateForm
-Fixed issue with crossLink tables with no primary key
-Fixed possible issue with tripleLinks regarding primary key
-Fixed possible problem with crossLinks and tripleLinks when no values are found
-Fixed possible problem with copies of DataObjects using factory";s:1:"f";s:5:"49059";s:1:"g";s:56:"http://pear.php.net/get/DB_DataObject_FormBuilder-0.13.1";s:1:"x";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:18:"package.0.13.1.xml";}}}
